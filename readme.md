# U.K. Train Station Location Data

I have complied a list of the train stations in the United Kingdom, the list contains:

- 3Alpha Code, formally CRS (Computer Reservation System) or NRS (National Reservation System) Code.
- Station Name
- Latitude
- Longitude

The data is available as a CSV and JSON file.



## Why?

I couldn't find this information as a complete downloadable set from anywhere on the internet. Maybe it is out there, but I couldn't find it.
